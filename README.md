# Sinance
Simple finances

# Please Note
This was a private project from 2014 and was started because of my discontent with existing "Home finance" solutions. The project runs fine and suits my needs but maybe not others, it needs more work and experimentation to become what I want it to be.

TODO: make build and deploy instructions.
