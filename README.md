# Sinance
Simple finances

# Please Note
This was a private project from 2014 and was started because of my discontent with existing "Home finance" solutions. This project runs fine and suits my needs but is in no way to be called "good software". It has recently been ported to .NET Core to be run inside of a container but there still is alot to do.

# Road to V2.0
I'm planning to work on some additional features such as: Planning/Budgeting/Forecasting and upgrading the Front-end to be more mobile friendly (and more friendly in general). But first The codebase needs to be updated and improved, this is more of a learning project for myself to do more MVC/Razor (Pages) type of things instead of slapping a SPA framework on top of it.
