# Sinance
Simple finances

# Please Note
This was a private project from 2014 and was started because of my discontent with existing "Home finance" solutions. This project runs fine and suits my needs but is in no way to be called "good software". It has recently been ported to .NET Core to be run inside of a container but there still is alot to do.

# To-do
A general list of things that really need doing:
- Create instructions to run the software
- Incorporate default (ING/ABN AMRO) import rules in the software
- Add (optional) demo data seed
- Refactor code from controllers to services
- Refactor database code
- Reorganize backend code in logical sections
- (re)Add unit tests
- Add predictions/planning
- Translate all dutch texts to english
- Update the javascript libraries(?)
- Split up big pages/sections to components
- Rebuild/update front-end

Other If I ever run out of things to do:
- Multilanguage support
- Add support to import any kind of CSV/TXT file for transactions
